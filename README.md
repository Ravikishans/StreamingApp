# Building a Secure DevOps Workflow with GitOps and Kubernetes

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a secure DevOps pipeline by leveraging GitOps principles to automate deployments to Kubernetes clusters. The workflow will include security checks, compliance audits, and secrets management to ensure that security best practices are followed throughout the application deployment lifecycle.

## Project Goals

- **Automate Deployments**: Implement a GitOps workflow to automate application deployment to Kubernetes clusters using tools like ArgoCD or Flux.
- **Integrate Security**: Incorporate security checks and compliance audits into the CI/CD pipeline to enforce security best practices and reduce vulnerabilities.
- **Version Control**: Ensure that all infrastructure and application changes are tracked and managed using version control, specifically Git.
- **Secrets Management**: Use HashiCorp Vault to manage sensitive information like API keys and passwords securely.

## Tools Used

- **GitOps**:
  - ArgoCD or Flux: GitOps tools for continuous delivery and Kubernetes management.
- **Container Orchestration**:
  - Kubernetes: A container orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Version Control**:
  - GitHub or GitLab: Version control systems used to store and manage application and infrastructure code.
- **CI/CD**:
  - Jenkins or GitLab CI: Continuous integration and continuous delivery tools to automate testing and deployment processes.
- **Security & Compliance**:
  - Snyk or Aqua Security: Tools for container security, vulnerability scanning, and compliance audits.
- **Secrets Management**:
  - HashiCorp Vault: Tool for securely managing secrets, such as API keys, passwords, and certificates.

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster (local, cloud, or managed service like GKE, EKS, or AKS).
- Access to GitHub or GitLab for version control and repository management.
- A running instance of ArgoCD or Flux for GitOps.
- Jenkins or GitLab CI setup for the CI/CD pipeline.
- HashiCorp Vault configured for secrets management.
- Snyk or Aqua Security account for container security scanning.

## Getting Started

### 1. Set up Kubernetes Cluster

Ensure you have access to a Kubernetes cluster. You can use a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, or set up a local Kubernetes environment using Minikube or kind (Kubernetes in Docker).

```bash
# Example for GKE setup
gcloud container clusters create my-cluster --zone us-central1-a

# StreamingApp
Collaborative Streaming application

## Backend

### AuthService
`.env` file for the Authentication Service.

```sh
PORT=3001
MONGO_URI="yourMongoDB_URIwithDatabaseName"
JWT_SECRET="writesomerandomsecrets"
AWS_KEY_ID='asfdasdfasfasf'
AWS_SECRET_KEY='adsafsasfdafs'
AWS_REGION='ap-south-1'
AWS_S3_BUCKET='streamingappservice'
```
ok
